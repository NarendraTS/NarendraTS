## 👋 Hi, I’m Narendra Babu

Software Engineer with 3+ years of experience building embedded-oriented and backend systems. I work close to the system layer, focusing on reliability, debugging, and maintainable software using **C++, Python, and Linux-based environments**.

I’ve worked on **production-grade backend services**, automation tools, and built a **SaaS-based Gym Management platform** with **AI/ML-assisted analytics** for usage insights and basic predictions. I enjoy solving problems that span **code, systems, and real-world constraints**.

### 📌 Projects & Code
I focus on building backend and system-oriented software.  
Please explore the pinned repositories below for selected projects and code samples.
I actively use AI tools to enhance productivity across development tasks such as requirement analysis, architecture exploration, debugging support, and test automation. I treat AI as an assistive tool, while core system design, implementation, and validation are driven by engineering fundamentals and hands-on problem solving.
