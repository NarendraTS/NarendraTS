## 👋 Hi, I’m Narendra Babu

Software Engineer with 3+ years of experience building embedded-oriented and backend systems. I work close to the system layer, focusing on reliability, system-level debugging, and maintainable software using **C++, Python, and Linux-based environments**.

I have experience developing **production-grade backend services**, automation tools, and building end-to-end systems. I’ve created multiple self-initiated platforms including a **Gym Management SaaS** with **AI/ML-assisted analytics** and a **Car Garage Management System** focused on workflow automation and operational efficiency. I enjoy solving problems that span **code, systems, and real-world constraints**.

### 🔧 What I work on
- Embedded-oriented software and system-level debugging  
- Backend services, REST APIs, and automation  
- Linux-based development and Git-driven workflows  
- Practical, AI-assisted productivity across development tasks  

---

### 🏗️ Selected Projects
- **Gym Management SaaS** – Backend-driven platform with member management, billing, analytics, and AI/ML-assisted insights for usage patterns and basic predictions  
- **Car Garage Management System** – Fully automated system for managing vehicle service workflows, job cards, inventory, billing, and customer records  
- **Embedded & Platform Systems** – Secure provisioning, validation, and system-level debugging for production environments  

---

### 🤖 AI & Engineering Workflow
I use AI tools as a productivity and problem-solving aid across the development lifecycle, including design exploration, debugging support, test case generation, and documentation. Core system design, implementation, and validation are driven by engineering fundamentals, with AI used to accelerate workflows rather than replace engineering judgment.

### 🌱 Currently improving
- Linux internals and OS-level behavior  
- Modern C++ practices  
- Backend scalability and reliability  
- Practical application of AI/ML in real-world products  

---

### 🤝 Open to collaboration on
- Backend systems and automation tools  
- Embedded software and system validation  
- Developer-focused tooling and SaaS platforms
